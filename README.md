This is the source code for [XIVGEAR](https://xivgear.com) based on Symfony 4 build for a LAMP Stack.

## Setting up
At first you need [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and the [vagrant-hostmanager](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-hostmanager) plugin.
> cd ./vm  
> vagrant up

### Linux
While vagrant up you have been asked if `vagrant-hostmanager` is allowed to edit your hosts file. If you have allowed this. You can simply go to [http://xivgear.local](http://xivgear.local)

### Windows
Since i don't have much experience with windows, i can't say how you could handle custom host settings. I recently used the Chrome-Addon "Host Switch Plus" which routes chrome itself to your custom host entries - no guarantee.

## Contributions
I'm not looking for contributions at this point. This project is mostly a big learning project for myself. Maybe some day - sorry!
